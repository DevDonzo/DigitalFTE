As a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Guelph, I've recently explored the fascinating intersection of AI automation and digital Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) development. One of my most impactful projects was automating my email responses, a task that often consumed valuable time and distracted me from my studies.

Using Python and the Claude Code framework, I created a script that intelligently categorizes incoming emails and drafts tailored responses based on keywords and context. This automation not only streamlined my communication but also ensured that I could maintain prompt responses to professors and peers, enhancing my academic collaboration.

The process involved training a machine learning model on common queries I've received, enabling it to generate contextually relevant replies. By implementing this solution, I've gained insights into the practical applications of AI and how it can significantly improve productivity, especially for students juggling multiple responsibilities.

This experience has solidified my passion for AI and its potential to transform everyday tasks. I encourage fellow students to consider how automation can optimize their workflows—every minute saved is an opportunity for learning and growth.
