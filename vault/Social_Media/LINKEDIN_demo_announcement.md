## Proposed Post

Excited to share what I've been building: Digital FTE, a personal AI employee system.

For years, we've talked about AI augmenting human work. I decided to build it myself.

What it does:
• Monitors 5 communication channels (email, messages, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook)
• Uses AI to draft intelligent responses (Claude 3.5)
• Implements human-in-the-loop approval for all actions
• Integrates with Xero for accounting
• Learns from patterns and optimizes over time

The architecture:
✓ Local-first (privacy by design)
✓ File-based state machine (resilient, auditable)
✓ Multi-layer deduplication (no duplicate processing)
✓ Graceful degradation (failures don't cascade)

Why it matters:
Personal productivity tools have been stagnant. But with modern LLMs + proper safeguards, we can build systems that genuinely extend human capability without the risks of uncontrolled autonomy.

Lessons learned:
1. HITL (human-in-the-loop) is non-negotiable
2. Transparency > automation speed
3. File-based workflows beat databases for resilience
4. AI should handle complexity, humans handle judgment

Open to discussing the architecture, lessons learned, or how to apply this approach to your workflow.
