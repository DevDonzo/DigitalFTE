## Proposed Post

I'm excited to announce Digital FTE - my personal AI employee! 🤖

For the past month, I've been building an autonomous system that:

✅ Monitors emails, messages, and social media 24/7
✅ Intelligently drafts responses with AI (but I always review first)
✅ Manages invoicing and accounting
✅ Filters out spam and automated emails
✅ Keeps me in the loop on everything important

This isn't about replacing human judgment - it's about extending my capacity to do more meaningful work while AI handles the routine stuff.

The system is:
• Local-first (privacy-focused)
• Transparent (I review everything)
• Integrated (works across all my tools)
• Scalable (runs on standard hardware)

If you're interested in personal AI automation or productivity systems, I'd love to chat!
