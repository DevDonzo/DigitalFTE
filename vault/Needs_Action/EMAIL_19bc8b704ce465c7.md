Hi Zepporah –



We had a great discussion with John on the Pensions use cases. He is very
knowledgeable in using AI in Pensions. It would be great to include him in
the AI Working Group going forward.



I have asked my team to setup bi-weekly meetings with him to track progress
on the PoCs. Attached is the relevant documentation. We will be tackling
P1-3 ( Pensions AI Use Case deck – slide 4). More to come on this.



@Ruest, Micah (SPAC/PSPC) (il-lui / he-him) <Micah.Ruest@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca>,
once I get some more information and direction from Zepporah we can even
look at tracking this as a high visibility high impact project.
