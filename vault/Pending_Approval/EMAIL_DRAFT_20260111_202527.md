## Proposed Response

It seems there was an issue with delivering an email to boss@company.com. 

1. The email was not delivered due to a timeout error from the recipient's server.
2. Gmail will continue to attempt delivery for the next 23 hours.
3. If the delivery fails permanently, a notification will be sent.

Next steps would be to either wait for the retry attempts or consider reaching out to the recipient through an alternative method if you need an urgent response.
