## Proposed Response

It seems there was an issue with delivering a message to boss@company.com.

1. The email was not delivered due to connectivity problems with the recipient's server, resulting in timeouts.
2. You might want to try resending the email later, as suggested in the notification.
3. If the issue persists, consider contacting the recipient through an alternative method or check if there are typos in the email address.

Next steps: I recommend attempting to resend the email after some time. If the failure continues, we can explore other options.
