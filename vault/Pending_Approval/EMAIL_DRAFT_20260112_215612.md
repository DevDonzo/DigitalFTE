## Proposed Response

It looks like there was an issue with delivering a message to boss@company.com.

1. The recipient server is currently not accepting connections, which is causing the delivery failure.
2. You can attempt to resend the message later, or check the provided support link for more details on the error.
3. If you need to reach out to the recipient urgently, consider using an alternative contact method.
