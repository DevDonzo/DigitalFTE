## Proposed Response

Dear Salman Paracha,

Thank you for your thoughtful consideration. I appreciate your concern for my well-being. However, as much as I'd love a vacation in Switzerland, it's important for me to manage my workload effectively at this time. Your kind offer means a lot to me, and I'll make sure to take some time for self-care in other ways.

I value your understanding and support, and I'm grateful to have colleagues like you who care about my well-being. Let's catch up soon to discuss work and perhaps plan a future vacation together. Thank you once again for your kindness.

Best regards,
Hamza
