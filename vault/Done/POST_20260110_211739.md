## Content

As a second-year Software Engineering student at the University of Guelph, my journey into AI automation has revolutionized the way I manage my email workflow. Transitioning from the daunting challenge of achieving inbox zero to embracing an automated system has not only saved me time but has also enhanced my productivity.

Utilizing Claude Code and Python, I developed a streamlined workflow that automates routine email tasks, from sorting to responding. By leveraging AI, I can prioritize important messages and filter out the noise, allowing me to focus on critical academic and project work.

This experience has not only deepened my understanding of digital full-time employee (FTE) development but has also highlighted the immense potential of AI in everyday tasks. Automation is not just a trend; it’s a powerful tool that can transform how we work and manage information.

I encourage fellow students and professionals to explore AI solutions that can optimize your workflows. The right tools can make a significant difference in your day-to-day operations.
